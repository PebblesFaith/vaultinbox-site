        <p class="sub">
          VaultInbox.cloud is being built as a modern alternative to physical proof-of-delivery workflows commonly handled through
          USPS Certified Mail and carrier “document express” services (UPS/FedEx). It delivers secure, compliance-first correspondence
          with tamper-evident event logging and evidence-oriented output—designed for high-trust and regulated environments.

            Tired of missed delivery slips and post-office trips? If a sender uses VaultInbox, you receive certified correspondence securely and digitally—with a controlled access flow and a reviewable proof record.
          </p>
          <p class="small" style="margin-top:8px;">
            VaultInbox improves outcomes on both sides: senders get stronger proof; recipients avoid physical failure modes.

          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>
            Proof-required document delivery is still dominated by physical processes: printing, handling, routing, missed delivery attempts,
            signature friction, and pickup trips. The result is higher cost, slower timelines, and recurring failure modes—
            loss, theft, exposure, and disputed receipt.
          </p>
          <p class="small" style="margin-top:8px;">
            Carriers excel at logistics. The weakness is the proof mechanism being tied to paper and manual steps.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <p>
            VaultInbox replaces the physical dependency with a cloud-native certified delivery workflow:
            unique tracking IDs, controlled recipient access, and an event timeline designed for audit and dispute review.
          </p>
          <p class="small" style="margin-top:8px;">
            Senders get faster, clearer proof; recipients avoid slips and pickup trips—while maintaining a defensible record posture.
          </p>

              “The U.S. mail ecosystem is a $257B market, but VaultInbox targets the $31–48B slice where people pay specifically for proof.
              Certified Mail exists because proof is required — VaultInbox delivers stronger proof without the physical failure modes.”

              VaultInbox competes on the proof layer—evidence, access control, retention—not parcel logistics.

          <h2>Why now</h2>
          <p>
            Physical volume trends and rising prices increase the burden of paper-based proof workflows.
            VaultInbox targets the proof layer—where customers already pay for verifiable delivery—by offering a digital-native alternative
            with stronger identity assurance and evidence-oriented records.
