          VaultInbox.cloud is being built as a modern alternative to physical proof-of-delivery workflows commonly handled through
          USPS Certified Mail and carrier “document express” services (UPS/FedEx). It delivers secure, compliance-first correspondence
          with tamper-evident event logging and evidence-oriented output—designed for high-trust and regulated environments.

          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>
            Proof-required document delivery is still dominated by physical processes: printing, handling, routing, missed delivery attempts,
            signature friction, and post-office or carrier pickup. The result is high operational cost, slower timelines, and persistent failure modes
            (loss, theft, exposure, and disputed receipt). While carriers excel at logistics, their proof mechanisms remain inherently tied to paper and manual steps.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <p>
            VaultInbox.cloud replaces the physical dependency with a cloud-native certified delivery workflow:
            unique tracking IDs, controlled recipient access, and an event timeline designed for audit and dispute review.
            Senders get faster, clearer proof; recipients avoid missed slips and pickup trips—while maintaining a defensible record posture.

          <h2>Why now</h2>
          <p>
            The U.S. delivery ecosystem is massive, but physical volume trends and rising prices increase the burden of paper-based proof workflows.
            VaultInbox targets the proof layer—where customers already pay a premium for verifiable delivery—by offering a digital-native alternative
            with stronger identity assurance and evidence-oriented records.

              and dispute defensibility (including USPS Certified Mail and carrier document express patterns).
