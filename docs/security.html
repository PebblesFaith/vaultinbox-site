    <p class="sub">
      VaultInbox.cloud is designed for <strong>proof-required communications</strong>—the same category of delivery problems historically
      handled by USPS Certified Mail and carrier document services (UPS/FedEx). This page describes high-level principles
      and control categories (not implementation secrets).
    </p>

    <div class="grid">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Least privilege</h3>
        <p>
          Access is scoped to the minimum required for each service, role, and action. Permissions are designed to be auditable and
          reviewable as the platform matures into pilots and enterprise use cases.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Strong recipient verification</h3>
        <p>
          Recipient access is designed to prefer modern, phishing-resistant controls such as <strong>Passkeys/WebAuthn</strong>,
          with <strong>Authenticator App (TOTP)</strong> support. Verification is treated as a compliance control, not a convenience feature.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Event integrity</h3>
        <p>
          Delivery lifecycle events are recorded in a traceable form intended for audit review and dispute workflows, with an emphasis on
          controlled state transitions and tamper-evident logging posture (Lockbox Protocol™).
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Defense in depth</h3>
        <p>
          Multiple layers of controls: authentication, authorization, secure session handling, CSRF protection, rate limiting,
          input validation, and secure storage patterns.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Encryption & secrets handling</h3>
        <p>
          Sensitive values are designed to be protected at rest and in transit. Where recovery workflows are required,
          VaultInbox uses a dual-control posture (e.g., verification hashes plus encrypted storage for controlled recovery paths).
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Operational integrity</h3>
        <p>
          The platform design favors clear, reviewable audit narratives: explicit actions, payment-confirmed finalization,
          consistent timestamps, and durable retention controls to support compliance operations.
        </p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Security posture note</h2>
      <p>
        VaultInbox is designed to reduce physical failure modes (loss, theft, missed delivery, manual handling) by replacing them with
        a controlled digital workflow. While no system can eliminate all risk, the intent is to strengthen identity assurance,
        improve traceability, and produce evidence-oriented records suitable for audit and dispute evaluation.
      </p>
      <p class="small" style="margin-top:10px;">
        Note: “admissibility” varies by jurisdiction and case context. VaultInbox’s posture is to improve defensibility,
        not to claim universal acceptance.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Disclosure note</h2>
      <p>
        Public materials describe architectural intent and control categories. Detailed security design, testing evidence,
        and implementation specifics are shared selectively with partners and investors under appropriate confidentiality.
